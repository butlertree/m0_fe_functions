# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?


I have been exposed to a lot of new material and ideas over the last couple of weeks.  I really struggled with the last challenge in the functions.js file.  It requred merging several new ideas, correctly setting up the proper logic, interpolating into the return value and for me the most difficult watching out for the syntax errors.  I'm most proud of how I stuck through the difficult parts and didn't get frusurated with myself.  The big win was getting it all to work and walking away with a very satisfied feeling.   

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

Functions are incredibly powerful because they allow the developer to create methods specific to the needs of a unique situation.  They also allow the developer to then reuse those created functions over and over as needed.
